## [Unreleased]

### Added

- FAZ 6: executor + three behavior modes (auto/ask/info) — the product's
  core execution loop. `internal/engine`: `Mode` (`auto`/`ask`/`info`) +
  `ResolveMode(flag, env, config)` implementing the exact flag >
  `COMRADE_MODE` > config precedence; `Execute(ctx, plan, mode, deps)
  (RunSummary, error)` dispatching to `info` (prints the plan, executes
  nothing), `ask` (per-step confirm via a decoupled `PromptUI` interface:
  `[e]vet`/`[h]ayır` run/skip, `[d]üzenle` re-evaluates the edited
  command through `safety.Engine` *before* ever running it — refusing and
  re-prompting on a newly-Blocked edit — `[a]çıkla` fetches an LLM
  explanation and re-prompts, `[t]ümü` auto-approves remaining
  read/write/network steps while still individually confirming
  destructive/elevated ones), and `auto` (sequential execution with a
  one-line status per step; destructive/elevated steps force the same
  confirm prompt unless `safety.confirm_destructive`/`confirm_elevated`
  is disabled *and* `--yolo` is set, which prints a mandatory red warning
  and proceeds — Block itself is never `--yolo`-bypassable in any mode,
  and a Block aborts the rest of an auto-mode plan). A failed step
  (nonzero exit, including timeout) triggers up to 3 total
  self-correction round-trips per run (ask the LLM for a revised command,
  re-evaluate it through safety before ever running it, retry), then
  stops with a summary and suggestion. Ctrl-C (`signal.NotifyContext`)
  cancels the run cleanly: the in-flight step's process group is killed
  by `internal/executor`, remaining steps are recorded skipped, and a
  full summary is printed. `internal/audit` is wired end-to-end: one
  JSONL entry per step that actually executed (never a Blocked/skipped
  one, never stdout/stderr content), lazy `retention_days` cleanup once
  per invocation; new `comrade history` (replacing the FAZ 0 stub) reads
  it back as a table or `--json`, `--limit N` (default 20), read-only.
  `comrade do <request...>` is now the real, no-longer-hidden pipeline
  (`--dry-run` unchanged from FAZ 5; new `--auto`/`--ask`/`--info`/
  `--yolo` flags); the root command now falls back to `do` for any arg
  vector that doesn't match a known subcommand (`comrade docker kur`
  works directly). New `[executor]` config section
  (`step_timeout_seconds`, default 300) for internal/executor's per-step
  timeout. Proven end-to-end against a real compiled binary, a real
  `*executor.Executor`, and an `httptest`-mocked `openai_compat` plan
  server: a benign step actually runs while a `rm -rf /` step the model
  mislabeled "read" is Blocked and never reaches the executor — see
  docs/phases/FAZ-06.md.
- FAZ 5: engine (plan generation) + safety rule engine — `internal/safety`:
  an LLM-independent, config-driven `Engine.Evaluate(command, declared)`
  implementing CLAUDE.md's five-class `RiskClass` (read/write/network/
  elevated/destructive, ascending severity) and `Action`
  (Allow/Confirm/Block). Every matcher runs against a single
  `normalizeCommand`'d form (all quote characters stripped, whitespace
  collapsed) rather than the raw string, so a stray quote can never defeat
  a rule. A hardcoded denylist (`rm -rf /`/`~`/`$HOME` variants and their
  near-equivalents — `//`, `/.`, trailing slashes, an absolute path to
  `rm` — canonicalized before matching; `mkfs`; `dd`/redirect writes to
  any real disk device, an explicit safe-pseudo-device allowlist
  (`null`/`zero`/`tty*`/`random`/`urandom`/`full`/`stdin`/`stdout`/
  `stderr`/`fd/*`/`pts/*`) aside; `diskpart`+`clean`; a PowerShell
  drive-root recursive delete recognized across the whole Remove-Item
  alias family (`Remove-Item`, `Remove-ItemProperty`, `ri`, `rd`,
  `rmdir`, `del`, `erase`, `rm`), accepting abbreviated
  (`-r`/`-rec`/`-fo`/...) and cmd.exe-legacy (`/s`/`/q`) flag spellings;
  `format <drive>:`; the classic fork bomb) always returns Block, plus
  `safety.denylist_extra` user regexes (an invalid one is skipped with
  one stderr warning at construction, never a crash); ten escalation
  rules (`rm -r`/`-f`, the same Remove-Item alias family with any
  target, `chmod -R 777`, disk-write redirects, registry `Remove-Item*`
  on `HKLM:`/`HKCU:`, `killall`/`taskkill /F`, `iptables -F`/`netsh
  advfirewall reset`, `git push --force`, `sudo`/`runas`/`-Verb RunAs`,
  package-manager installs, network verbs) only ever raise a command's
  effective risk, never lower it — a step the LLM declared `destructive`
  stays `destructive` even when nothing else matches. 236 table-driven
  sub-cases across both Unix and PowerShell command families (up from an
  initial 99 after an independent security review's `CHANGES_REQUIRED`
  hardening pass, plus a residual `path.Clean`-based fix on
  re-verification — see docs/phases/FAZ-05.md), including the documented
  near-miss set (`rm -rf ./build`/`rm -rf ~/project` escalate but never
  Block) and the deliberately-accepted `echo "rm -rf /"` quoted false
  positive (fail-closed by design).
  `internal/engine`: `Planner.GeneratePlan` builds a `go:embed`'d system
  prompt (English core instruction + a Turkish block injected per
  `general.language`'s auto/LANG resolution) carrying the OS/arch/shell/
  cwd/package-manager/admin context (never env values), requests a
  single structured-JSON completion through a minimal `Completer`
  interface any `*llm.Client` satisfies, recovers from an empty `steps`
  array or a `max_auto_steps` overrun with exactly one automatic
  corrective re-prompt each (hard error / hard-truncate-with-a-summary-
  marker respectively if the retry doesn't fix it), fails closed to
  `RiskDestructive` for any step whose `risk` label doesn't parse, and
  runs every step through `safety.Engine` before returning — the LLM's
  declared risk is never the last word. New hidden `comrade do
  <request...> --dry-run` (execution itself is FAZ 6's job; without
  `--dry-run` this phase refuses to run at all) renders the plan as a
  `STEP|COMMAND|RISK|REVERSIBLE|RATIONALE` table showing the safety
  engine's own verdict — `CONFIRM(<effective risk>)` or
  `BLOCKED(<reason>)` — never the model's raw declared risk, proven
  end-to-end against an `httptest` mock `openai_compat` server whose
  canned "docker kur" plan includes a `sudo apt-get install` (elevated)
  step and a `rm -rf /` decoy step the model itself labels `read` and
  that still renders Blocked.
- FAZ 4: shell integration — `comrade init [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]`
  (replacing the FAZ 0 stub) installs an idempotent, marker-delimited
  hook block (`internal/shellinit`, `go:embed`'d per-shell snippets)
  into the shell's rc/profile file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` respecting
  `ZDOTDIR`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish` respecting
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, or a PowerShell `$PROFILE` actually resolved by
  invoking `pwsh`/`powershell` — never guessed); `--print` shows the
  snippet only, `--remove` uninstalls it, `--yes` skips the
  confirmation prompt. Every hook execs a new hidden `comrade hook
  record --shell <name> --exit <code> --command <text>` subcommand
  instead of hand-assembling JSON in shell script (unsafe for arbitrary
  command text — see docs/phases/FAZ-04.md), which atomically writes
  `last_command.json` via a new `context.WriteLastCommand` (temp file +
  rename). Hooks intentionally record only command/exit code/timestamp/
  shell, never stderr/stdout (FAZ 7's `comrade fix --rerun` owns
  capturing that, by re-running the command directly). New
  `scripts/install.sh` / `scripts/install.ps1` download, checksum-verify,
  and install the latest (or pinned) release binary, then suggest
  `comrade init`.
- FAZ 3: context collector + redaction — `internal/context`: DI-friendly
  `Collector`/`Collect(ctx, Options) Context` gathering OS/arch, shell
  type + best-effort version, working/home dir, admin/root status
  (windows honestly reports "not checked" rather than guessing),
  detected package managers (`apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`/`zypper`/`brew`/`port`/
  `winget`/`scoop`/`choco`), `last_command.json` reader (format now
  defined here; FAZ 4's shell hooks will write it), and opt-in shell
  history (bash/zsh/fish/PowerShell PSReadLine) + env-var *names*
  (never values). `internal/redact`: `Redactor.Apply` masks API keys
  (`sk-`/`ghp_`/`gho_`/`AKIA`/`xox[baprs]-`), JWTs, PEM private-key
  blocks, `password=`/`token=`/etc. credential kv pairs (value only,
  key name kept visible), and `Authorization: Bearer` tokens — plus
  optional email/IP masking (never masking `127.0.0.1`/`0.0.0.0`/`::1`).
  Wired as a **non-bypassable middleware** in `internal/llm.Client`:
  `Complete`/`Stream` redact `System` + every message's `Content` before
  any connector call, hardwired from `cfg.Privacy` inside `New(cfg)` with
  no external way to inject a no-op redactor — proven by an `httptest`
  based test asserting a real secret never reaches the wire.
- FAZ 2: LLM provider layer — `internal/llm`: the CLAUDE.md `Provider`
  interface plus four unexported connectors talking raw `net/http` (no
  SDKs, zero new go.mod dependencies): `anthropic` (Messages API, SSE
  streaming, `529 overloaded_error` handling), `openai_compat` (one
  connector for OpenAI/Mistral/Groq/GLM/Qwen/Kimi/OpenRouter/LM Studio,
  distinguished by `base_url`), `google` (Gemini `generateContent`,
  path-encoded model, `x-goog-api-key` header), `ollama` (`/api/chat` +
  `/api/tags`-backed `ListModels` for its dynamic default model).
  Connector constructors are unexported; `llm.New(cfg)` building a
  `*Client` is the only way to reach the network from this package.
  `internal/llm/parse.go`'s `ExtractJSON`/`ValidateInto` strip markdown
  fences and validate a caller-declared set of required JSON fields in
  the model's response text. `Client` resolves `llm.provider`+`llm.model`
  plus `llm.fallback` into an ordered attempt chain: 401/403 stops the
  chain immediately, everything else (timeout, network error, 429/5xx/
  529, parse failure, missing API key) retries the next attempt, logged
  to stderr per attempt under `COMRADE_DEBUG=1`. API keys resolve from
  `COMRADE_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` then each provider's well-known env var.
  New hidden command `comrade config test-llm` sends a ping completion
  through the full fallback chain and prints provider/model/latency.
- FAZ 1: config system — `internal/config` (viper-backed TOML schema,
  `~/.config/cli-comrade/config.toml` / `%APPDATA%\cli-comrade\config.toml`
  path resolution with `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` support, first-run default-file
  creation, `COMRADE_` env overrides including the named
  `COMRADE_MODE`/`COMRADE_PROVIDER`/`COMRADE_MODEL` aliases); real
  `comrade config` command tree (`get`/`set`/`list`/`edit`/`path`)
  replacing the FAZ 0 stub, with type/enum-validated `set` and an
  aligned `list` table showing each key's source (default/file/env).
- FAZ 0: project skeleton — Go module, `internal/`/`cmd/` directory layout,
  cobra root command (`comrade --version` / `--help`), stub subcommands
  (`fix`, `explain`, `chat`, `config`, `init`, `history`), Makefile
  (`build`/`test`/`lint`/`vet`/`cross`/`tools`), `.golangci.yml`, GitHub
  Actions CI (build/test/lint across ubuntu/macos/windows), base
  `.goreleaser.yaml`, README, LICENSE.
